 Hand cricket is a fun, 1vs1 game played by representing numbers with hand gestures. The players can choose a number from 1 to 10 for either batting or bowling and if both the players choose the same number, then the player who chose to bat is Out. And then the one who bowled becomes the batsman and target for the new batsman is the score of old batsman + 1. 
 For eg., if both the players chose the same number and the score was 73,then the bowler takes the turn of batsman and is required to score 74 . If not, then the first batsman is declared the winner.

Toss: 
 --> The players choose for themselves if they want to be odd or even.
 --> The players then choose a number from 1 to 6 and after they have placed the number, both the numbers are added and if the final number is odd or even, then the player who chose either odd or even can choose to bat or bowl respectively. For eg., if player 1 chose odd, then player 2 is even. Then player 1 chooses 3 and player 2 chooses 4, then the sum is 3+4 = 7 which is odd  and then player 1 has to choose to either bowl or bat.
 
 Match:
  --> The aim of bowler is to defeat the batsman by guessing the next number and choosing the same number so the batsman is out.
  --> The aim of batsman is to score as much runs as possible.
